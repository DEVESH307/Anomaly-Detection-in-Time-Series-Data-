# Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data with Keras

## Welcome!
Welcome to **Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data with Keras**. [Anomaly detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_detection) is the process of identifying unexpected items or events in data sets, which differ from the norm. And anomaly detection is often applied on unlabeled data which is known as unsupervised anomaly detection. Anomaly detection has two basic assumptions:
- Anomalies only occur very rarely in the data.
- Their features differ from the normal instances significantly.

## Project Objectives
In this project, we are going to focus on **three** learning objectives:
1. Build an LSTM Autoencoder in Keras
2. Detect anomalies with Autoencoders in time series data
3. Create interactive charts and plots with Plotly and Seaborn

By the end of this project, we will be able to design and build an **LSTM autoencoder in Keras to detect anomalies** in the S&P 500 index and other time series data.

## Project Structure
### Task 1: Project Overview and Import Libraries
### Task 2: Load and Inspect the S&P 500 Index Data
### Task 3: Data Preprocessing
### Task 4: Temporalize Data and Create Training and Test Splits
### Task 5: Build an LSTM Autoencoder
### Task 6: Train the Autoencoder
### Task 7: Plot Metrics and Evaluate the Model
### Task 8: Detect Anomalies in the S&P 500 Index Data
